## Motivation

Due to the declining birth rate in Singapore, our group will like to find out what factors that are young men are looking for in their female counterparts. 


## Libraries used

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Statsmodels
- Pylab
- Sklearn


## Data preparation & cleaning

- Renaming columns
- Removing NaN and duplicate values
- Filtering age groups to 18-25 (Target age group)
- Converting catergorical to binary values 

## EDA

### Numerical EDA
- Univariate non-graphical 
1. .describe()
2. skewness and kurtosis
- Univariate graphical
1. Boxplot
2. Histogram
3. Violin plot
- Multi-variate graphical
1. Heatmap

### Catergorical EDA
- Univariate non-graphical
1. Data distribution in each catergory
- Univariate graphical
1. Bar graph 
2. Box plot
- Multi-variate graphical
1. Layered histogram
2. Box plot 

## Machine learning

Part 1) Linear regression with numerical variables
Part 2) Chi-square test with catergorical variables
Part 3) K-mean clustering with 3 predictors and 1 response variable
